Samples Naming Convention
-------------------------
The samples use the naming convention with the following syntax:

MM_NNNN_SS

This translates as follows:

MM: Two-letter abbreviation for the sample collection: C1 (Cassette 1), C2 (Cassette 2), or CL (Clean).

NNNN: Four-character abbreviation for the instrument name.

SS (only for hi-hats): Specifies the playing technique - CL (closed) and OP (Open).
